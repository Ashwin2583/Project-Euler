> ## Multiples of 3 and 5
>
> ### Problem Statement
>
> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3,5,6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

> ## Even Fibonacci Numbers
>
> ### Problem Statement
> 
> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the 10 terms will be:<br>
> 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...<br>
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-values terms.
